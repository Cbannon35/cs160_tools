Dear ~NAME~,

We hope this email finds you well. This is an email letting you know the following extensions have been approved, BUT you asked for more time than we allow.

~ASSIGNMENT~ has been extended by +3 days (originally ~DUE_DATE~).

NOTE: we do not allow extensions past 3 days except for extreme circumstances. Please respond if you believe your situation requires further discussion with a TA.

Best,
Chris + CS160 staff
